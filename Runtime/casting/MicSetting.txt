SamplingRateComputation Algorithm
sampling rate = x
bit rate = y
average loop time = t(s) ==> tm(ms) / 1000 ( t < 1 )
buffer_len = L ==> In this case "length sec"

Algorithm ==> (y / 8) * x = (L * (y / 8)) / t

==> x = (8 / y) * (L * y) / (8 * t) ==> L / t

x = L / t

t is smaller ==> underRun
otherwise, t is bigger ==> overRun
